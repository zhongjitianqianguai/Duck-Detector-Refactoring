 * Lets one app zygote carrier start at a time, and turns the rest of a scan away once one start

 * A package has one app zygote, which every `android:useAppZygote` service shares. When it cannot
 * start, ActivityManager stops all of the package's services, not only the one it was starting
 * (frameworks/base ProcessList.handleProcessStart -> forceStopPackageLocked, "start failure"), so
 * each further attempt in the same scan stops every helper that is still running again. Starts run
 * one at a time so that two carriers cannot both reach that path before either has reported back.
