/**
 * Gives every detector that reads the carrier during one scan the same collection.
 *
 * The SELinux and LSPosed scans both read the SELinux carrier, and the dashboard and the SDK start
 * them together. A collection that began at or after a caller's own scan start was gathered during
 * that scan, so the caller takes it rather than starting the carrier's app zygote again. One that
 * began earlier belongs to an older scan, and the caller collects afresh.
