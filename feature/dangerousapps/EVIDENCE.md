# Dangerous Apps evidence record

Status: reviewed

The Dangerous Apps detector asks whether root managers, hooking frameworks and similar tools are installed, including when package visibility filtering or hiding modules keep them out of PackageManager.

## Signals

### PackageManager inventory

- Observable signal: installed packages from PackageManager, and targets PackageManager omits although other methods find them.
- Producing subsystem: PackageManager and its package visibility filtering.
- Mechanism: an installed target appears in PackageManager unless visibility filtering or a hiding module removes it.
- References: frameworks/base core/java/android/content/pm/PackageManager.java; capability/packageinventory/EVIDENCE.md.
- Applicability: full visibility needs QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES from the host.
- Visibility limits: restricted visibility is reported; hidden-from-PackageManager findings are only computed under full visibility.
- Result states: detected, hidden from PackageManager, restricted, clean.
- Interpretation: an installed target is a finding at its category's severity; hiding from PackageManager is stronger.

### Filesystem and provider methods

- Observable signal: package contexts, APK file descriptors, directory listings with zero-width and ignorable codepoints, FUSE stats, the native /data/data stat and tool-specific special paths.
- Producing subsystem: the filesystem through DAC, SELinux and MediaProvider's FUSE layer.
- Mechanism: each method reaches the package's files by a path PackageManager filtering does not control.
- References: capability/packageinventory/EVIDENCE.md (data directory stat); kernel/common Documentation/filesystems/proc.rst for fd views. Discovery only for the Unicode path bypass methods.
- Applicability: every release; FUSE behaviour depends on the MediaProvider version.
- Visibility limits: the native stat can fail to run, which the report records as an issue instead of no hits.
- Result states: detected by method, method not run, clean.
- Interpretation: each method adds evidence for the same package; findings list every method that saw it.

### Tool-specific channels

- Observable signal: the Scene loopback and broadcast channels, Thanox IPC, and enabled accessibility services.
- Producing subsystem: the tools' own services.
- Mechanism: these tools answer on fixed local channels.
- References: Discovery only: the channels follow each tool's observed behaviour.
- Applicability: every release.
- Visibility limits: a tool that is installed but not running does not answer.
- Result states: detected, clean.
- Interpretation: an answering tool is a finding for that tool.
