/**
 * How many StrongBox signing operations this app held at once, and why counting stopped.
 *
 * This is reported as an observation and never scored as an anomaly, because the number is not a
 * property of StrongBox:
 *
 * - `IKeyMintDevice` requires implementations to "support 32 concurrent operations", and the
 *   Keystore implementer reference documents at least 16 with one reserved for `vold`. Both are
 *   floors, so exceeding them is compliant behaviour rather than a deviation.
 * - When KeyMint answers `TOO_MANY_OPERATIONS`, keystore2 does not fail the caller. `operation.rs`
 *   prunes an existing operation and retries, and its candidate search ends in
 *   `candidate.or(oldest_caller_op)` — this app's own earlier handles are eligible. The framework
 *   opts app operations into that: pre-keystore2 `AndroidKeyStoreSignatureSpiBase` passes `true`
 *   for `begin`'s pruneable flag, commented "permit aborting this operation if keystore runs out of
 *   resources".
 * - Pruning is scored on inactivity age and sibling count rather than a fixed cap, and operations
 *   held by other processes compete for the same slots, so the reachable number is not stable
 *   between runs on one device.
 *
 * The count therefore describes KeyMint slots, the `km_compat` slot manager, and keystore2's
 * pruning policy jointly, and no single one of those can be attributed from it.

 * `checkValidKeySize`, which runs before any request reaches Keystore. A parameter set that method
 * refuses is never put to KeyMint, so the key not being created says nothing about this device's
