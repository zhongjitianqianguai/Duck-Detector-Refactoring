 * RKP 链的 ProvisioningInfo 扩展（OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.1.30）里 map[3] 是设备厂商名，由 RKP 服务器下发

 * On an RKP chain the ProvisioningInfo extension (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.1.30) carries the device manufacturer in
 * map[3], issued by the RKP server, while ATTESTATION_ID_MANUFACTURER in the leaf mirrors Build.MANUFACTURER and
 * comes from KeyMint. The two sources are independent, so rewriting only one side fails to line up.
