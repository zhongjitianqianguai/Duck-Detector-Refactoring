# Native Root evidence record

Status: reviewed

The Native Root detector asks whether kernel-level root solutions (KernelSU and its forks, APatch or KernelPatch, Magisk) leave evidence an ordinary app can observe. Findings are evidence of root tooling; their absence does not prove a device is unrooted.

## Signals

### KernelPatch supercall probes

- Observable signal: whether syscall 45 reads its first argument before the truncate body rejects a negative length (superkey residency), and the timing gap between a long and an empty key (pre-84169d5d builds).
- Producing subsystem: the arm64 kernel syscall table, which KernelPatch patches.
- Mechanism: a stock kernel rejects the negative length in do_sys_truncate before deriving a user pointer, so an untouched page stays non-resident; KernelPatch's handler reads arg0 first and faults it in.
- References: kernel/common fs/open.c (do_sys_truncate rejects a negative length before any path lookup). Discovery only for KernelPatch's handler order, which follows the probe authors' reading of KernelPatch.
- Applicability: arm64 processes only; the negative superkey result is trusted only on kernels up to 6.6, where KernelPatch's read faults the page.
- Visibility limits: seccomp can block syscall 45 in the child; other ABIs use another syscall numbering and report the probes as not run.
- Result states: detected, clean (arm64, measured), unavailable (other ABI, blocked, unmeasured, unusable run).
- Interpretation: a residency hit is conclusive on any version; everything short of a measured run is Unavailable.

### Netlink permission boundary

- Observable signal: whether RTM_GETLINK or RTM_GETNEIGH dumps are answered, and whether they expose a physical MAC or a LAN neighbour.
- Producing subsystem: SELinux's netlink_route_socket checks in the kernel and the loaded policy.
- Mechanism: ACK requires nlmsg_readpriv and nlmsg_getneigh when the policy carries Android's netlink config bits; untrusted app domains are denied them.
- References: kernel/common security/selinux/nlmsgtab.c (android11-5.4 through android15-6.6); external/selinux libsepol/src/write.c at android-11.0.0_r1 through android-14.0.0_r1; system/sepolicy app_neverallows.te and untrusted_app_25/27/29/30.te at android-11, 12 and 13 and main; platform/cts tests/tests/selinux/common SELinuxTargetSdkTestBase.java.
- Applicability: RTM_GETLINK is denied from Android 11 to apps targeting SDK 30 or later and from Android 13 to every untrusted app; RTM_GETNEIGH is denied only from Android 13 to apps targeting SDK 32 or later.
- Visibility limits: the check is skipped where the denial does not apply to this process, which the target SDK of an SDK host decides.
- Result states: enforced, not enforced, not applicable, not evaluated.
- Interpretation: an answered request that exposes hardware addresses is a DANGER finding about the boundary, without attributing it to a particular root solution.

### KernelSU interfaces

- Observable signal: the KernelSU prctl magic, the read-only supercall through a sacrificial child, [ksu_driver] and [ksu_fdwrapper] descriptors, the su SELinux domain, and devpts labels.
- Producing subsystem: KernelSU's kernel module or built-in patches.
- Mechanism: KernelSU answers its own prctl option and installs its driver through the reboot magic, and labels su PTYs as ksu_file.
- References: Discovery only: these interfaces follow KernelSU's behaviour as implemented by the probes; KernelSU's source was not reviewed in this pass.
- Applicability: KernelSU and forks that keep these interfaces.
- Visibility limits: KernelSU hides most interfaces from apps it does not grant; seccomp can block the helper's reboot call.
- Result states: detected, clean, blocked, unavailable.
- Interpretation: direct interface answers are DANGER; a blocked or unattempted probe reduces coverage.

### SUSFS setresuid side channel

- Observable signal: how the kernel answers a child's setresuid to a lower uid.
- Producing subsystem: the kernel's credential checks and any SUSFS or KernelSU hook on them.
- Mechanism: bionic's app seccomp filter allows setresuid, so the call reaches the kernel, which returns EPERM to an unprivileged app; old SUSFS hooks kill the child instead.
- References: bionic libc/SECCOMP_BLOCKLIST_APP.TXT and libc/seccomp/seccomp_policy.cpp.
- Applicability: every ABI; regular app processes, not app zygote children.
- Visibility limits: fork or waitpid can fail, which leaves the result not observed.
- Result states: denied, killed, UID changed, not observed.
- Interpretation: SIGKILL and a successful UID change are DANGER; only a denial is Normal.

### Root solution paths and temp root artifacts

- Observable signal: root manager paths, residue paths and temp root tooling in /data/local/tmp.
- Producing subsystem: the filesystem as seen through DAC and SELinux.
- Mechanism: root solutions keep their files in fixed locations, and public temp-root tools stage their payloads in /data/local/tmp.
- References: system/core rootdir/init.rc (AOSP never creates /data/adb); system/sepolicy private/file_contexts (/data/adb is adb_data_file) and private/untrusted_app_all.te (apps may stat shell_data_file); NVD CVE-2026-43499 for the GhostLock tooling names.
- Applicability: every release; /data/adb exists only where a root solution or userdebug adbd created it.
- Visibility limits: a path whose parent this app cannot search is not observable; such rules are reported, not counted as checked.
- Result states: present, absent, not observable.
- Interpretation: present paths are findings at their catalog severity; unobservable paths reduce coverage to SUPPORT.

### Process, cgroup, mount namespace and kernel traces

- Observable signal: suspicious processes, per-UID cgroup trees that disagree with the Java view, mount namespace drift between the app and an isolated helper, and root tokens in kallsyms, modules, uname or properties.
- Producing subsystem: procfs and cgroupfs, the mount namespace set up by zygote, and the kernel's exported symbol tables.
- Mechanism: root solutions run daemons, give processes distinct mount namespaces, and leave kernel symbols or properties with recognisable names.
- References: kernel/common Documentation/filesystems/proc.rst (status, mountinfo, ns); frameworks/base core/jni/com_android_internal_os_Zygote.cpp for zygote's per-app mount setup. Discovery only for the token catalogs.
- Applicability: every release; kallsyms addresses and modules are usually hidden from apps.
- Visibility limits: /proc of other UIDs is normally denied; denied entries are counted, not read as clean.
- Result states: detected, clean, limited, unavailable.
- Interpretation: kernel and process tokens are indirect evidence and never outweigh a direct probe.

### KernelSU manager scans and shell tmp metadata

- Observable signal: the throne hunt, which is an inotify watch on this package's directory installed from app_zygote while packages.list is rewritten; the public manager manifest under the KernelSU package name; and the owner, mode and inode of /data/local/tmp.
- Producing subsystem: KernelSU's throne tracker, PackageManager's mime group path, and the filesystem.
- Mechanism: setMimeGroup makes system_server rewrite packages.list, KernelSU's manager tracker then walks package directories, and the inherited watch sees that walk; a changed shell tmp owner or mode shows the directory was recreated.
- References: frameworks/base core/java/android/content/pm/PackageManager.java (setMimeGroup); frameworks/base services/core/java/com/android/server/pm/PackageManagerService.java (setMimeGroup rejects a group the package does not declare, then schedules the settings write that rewrites packages.list; Android 11 through main); frameworks/base core/java/com/android/internal/pm/parsing/pkg/PackageImpl.java (a package declares the MIME groups of every component's intent filters, services included; ParsingPackageImpl before Android 14); system/core rootdir/init.rc (/data/local/tmp is created shell:shell). Discovery only for the throne tracker's traversal and the manager manifest traits.
- Applicability: the throne hunt needs this package's directory to be watchable from app_zygote.
- Visibility limits: a denied watch, an unapplied stimulus or restricted package visibility reduce coverage; a high inode alone is weak.
- Result states: detected, clean, limited, unavailable.
- Interpretation: a traversal hit is danger; manifest traits are auxiliary; shell tmp owner or mode drift is a warning.

## Known gaps

- The KernelSU interface probes and the kernel token catalogs rest on tool behaviour, not on a reviewed tool source.
- The devpts check treats a root-owned PTY as root evidence, which userdebug builds also produce.
