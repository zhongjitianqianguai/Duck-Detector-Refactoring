/**
 * The detection work that has to run in the app zygote, before any isolated process forks from it.
 *
 * The SDK's manifest names this class in `android:zygotePreloadName`, so a host gets it without
 * declaring anything; a host with its own [ZygotePreload] delegates to it. It runs every
 * detector's app zygote preload in catalog order and then captures the SELinux context validity
 * evidence that the SELinux and LSPosed detectors read from their app zygote carriers. Without it,
 * both carriers report their app zygote evidence as unavailable.
